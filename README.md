A remake of my original discord bot, with more modular internals.
    
If for some reason you want to run this on your system, create a 2 files in the project's directory, one called `token.txt` and one called `musicapikey.txt`.  Paste your discord bot token into `token.txt` and a youtube api key into `musicapikey.txt`.
